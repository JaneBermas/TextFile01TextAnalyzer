Ever since we met, there is been a spark I cant ignore.
Your smile is like sunshine on a cloudy day, and your laughter, music to my ears. 
Every moment we share, no matter how small, feels like a treasured memory.
I admire your kindness, your strength, and the way you make the world a better place just by being in it.
I find myself thinking about you constantly, wondering if you might feel the same.
You inspire me to be a better person,and I would love to get to know you more and see where this journey takes us.
